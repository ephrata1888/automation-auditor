# Automation Auditor

A modular, multi-agent architecture for auditing software repositories and accompanying PDF reports. The system orchestrates parallel "Detective" agents, aggregates structured evidence, and prepares for a judicial synthesis layer.

---

## Architecture Overview

The system is built around a LangGraph `StateGraph` architecture with explicit fan-out and fan-in synchronization points and a deterministic judicial synthesis layer.

### Components

- **Detectives (Parallel Fan-Out)**
  - `RepoInvestigator` – Repository structure, git history, safe sandboxed cloning, and AST-based graph/state inspection. Optionally uses an LLM (OpenAI) to summarize git history for orchestration assessment.
  - `DocAnalyst` – PDF ingestion and chunked querying (RAG-lite) for theoretical depth and host path accuracy. Optionally uses an LLM (OpenAI) to assess concept depth in the report.
  - `VisionInspector` – Diagram extraction and multimodal inspection (Google Gemini free-tier vision when `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set; otherwise stub).
- **EvidenceAggregator (Fan-In)**
  - Collects and merges structured `Evidence` objects using typed reducers on `AgentState`.
- **Judges (Parallel Fan-Out)**
  - `Prosecutor`, `Defense`, `TechLead` – persona-specific LLM evaluators that emit `JudicialOpinion` objects
    (score, argument, cited_evidence) over the same shared `Evidence`.
- **ChiefJustice (Final Fan-In + Deterministic Synthesis)**
  - Applies hardcoded, rule-based overrides aligned with the Automation Auditor Input Rubric:
    - **Rule of Security** – confirmed security flaws cap the score at 3.
    - **Rule of Evidence (Fact Supremacy)** – Detective evidence overrules hallucinated Defense claims.
    - **Rule of Functionality** – TechLead’s modular-architecture confirmation carries highest weight for architecture criteria.
    - **Statutes** – Orchestration Fraud, Technical Debt, and Structured-Output / Hallucination Liability caps.
  - Produces a final `AuditReport` and a Markdown audit file (`audit_report.md`) with Executive Summary, Criterion Breakdown, and Remediation Plan.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ephrata1888/automation-auditor.git
cd automation-auditor

```

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

---

## Environment Setup

Copy the environment template:

```bash
cp .env.example .env

```

Fill in any required API keys. Optional: set `GEMINI_API_KEY` (or `GOOGLE_API_KEY`) for VisionInspector diagram analysis using Google Gemini’s free tier. RepoInvestigator and DocAnalyst optionally use **OpenAI** (e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY`) for LLM summaries and concept-depth assessment; Judges use OpenAI for evaluations. See `.env.example`.

---

## Example Usage

### Audit a Public Repository

```bash
python -m src.main \
  --repo https://github.com/example/project \
  --report path/to/report.pdf

```

What happens internally:

1. Repository is cloned in a sandboxed temporary directory.
2. Detectives execute in parallel.
3. Evidence is aggregated using typed reducers on `AgentState`.
4. Judges evaluate the same structured evidence in parallel, emitting `JudicialOpinion` objects.
5. ChiefJustice applies deterministic rubric rules and writes `audit_report.md` plus a structured `AuditReport`.

---

### Audit a Local Repository with PDF

```bash
python -m src.main \
  --repo ./local_repo \
  --report ./report.pdf

```

---

## StateGraph Flow

The architecture implements:

- Detective fan-out (parallel execution from `START`)
- EvidenceAggregator fan-in (state merge)
- Judge fan-out (parallel `Prosecutor`, `Defense`, `TechLead` from `EvidenceAggregator`)
- ChiefJustice fan-in and deterministic synthesis (final markdown + `AuditReport`)

See the PDF report for the full diagram (Figure 1).

---

## Reproducibility

This repository includes a `requirements.txt` file generated via `pip freeze` to ensure deterministic dependency installation.

To recreate the environment exactly:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Design Principles

- **Typed State Management** – Pydantic models enforce structured data flow.
- **Deterministic Merging** – Explicit reducers prevent race-condition overwrites.
- **Sandboxed Execution** – Git operations run in isolated temporary directories.
- **AST-Based Code Analysis** – Structural parsing preferred over regex for robustness.
- **Extensible Judicial Layer** – Designed for persona-driven LLM evaluation with rule-based synthesis.

---

## Current Status

- Detective layer: Implemented (RepoInvestigator and DocAnalyst optionally use OpenAI; VisionInspector uses Gemini when `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set).
- Evidence aggregation: Implemented
- Vision integration: Optional Google Gemini (free tier); set `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env`. Falls back to stub if unset.
- Judicial layer: Planned (Judges use OpenAI).
- ChiefJustice synthesis engine: Planned
